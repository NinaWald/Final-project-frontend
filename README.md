The final project made by Nina Waldreus, Frontend student at Technigo;
A Flower webshop.
Is responsive and works well on mobile, tablet and desktop

Tech:

Frontend:
React, Redux, CMS Contentful, CSS, Styled Components, MUI-materials for buttons/icons, npm package carousel.
Navigation using React Router 
Netlify for deployment.

Backend:
MongoDB, MongoDB database Compass/Atlas, mongoose, Postman, Node.js, Express API cors, bcrypt.
Google cloud for deployment and MongoDB for storing the database (user members)

I made a webshop using React and Redux to handle the state of the products and user actions.
I used a CMS called Contentful to put my products in. 
I added name, image, price, description and category in my content model. I then fetched the products using an api key that I got from the Contentful.
I created a backend with the user registration, login and delete user endpoints, and i fetched that in my frontend using the async await and try catch block.
